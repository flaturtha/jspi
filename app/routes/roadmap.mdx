# NFT Project Roadmap

## my vision

- explore _DECENTALIZED STORYTELLING ... DST or DSTOR_ and the idea of _open source, community owned character IPs_ within a centralized metaverse (ironic; meaning it's unique metaverse environment not top-down governance) -> article on decentalized Hollywood
- explore and seek to understand blockchain, web3, crypto, and what decentalization can really mean in our world ... by taking the concepts to the *n*th degree in a fictional future world of NYC in 2047 and play with the benefits and the terrors of decentalization
- build a collaborative storytelling system where others can tell independent stories within the defined universe/metaverse by minting/staking (not sure of terminology) characters ... creators (or _instigators_) would have, say, a 35% take in their characters or stories and 65% would go to the DAO treasury
- build a community around $SPUTNIK coins and this metaverse of storytellers and collectors/investors/enthusiasts ... an ACTIVE community!
- create and grow a _characterDAO_
- build a series of fundraising projects:
  1.  pre-TBCv2 short stories that build to and create anticipation of TBCv2 ... crowdfunding via mirror.xyz
  2.  100 + 400 TBCv1 NFT launch & holder benefits => 1st week of May 2022
  3.  $SPUTNIK tokens
  4.  10,000 edition hardback, slipcased print editions of TBCv2 + ebook editions
      - similar approach as PUNKS COMIC with ability to burn ebook & keep print and/or vice versa for specific benefits TBD
      - and after (but potentially before!!) NFT launch, publish ebook & paperback editions on Amazon, etc., with NFT holders buying numerous copies daily to drive it to #1 on multiple lists, thus enhancing the value
  5.  standard jpg image NFT collection of characters, each with specific hit points and capabilities (beyond simple rarity factors, and which may change & grow as new stories are created and they play big or small roles) ... some common, small or bit (but expandable) & some rare or ultra-rare (like Joe, himself)
      - NFT mini collections ... random and hidden (until purchased) sets of 10 NFT characters ... could be all commons or all rares or a combination
- expand, with community approval, etc., into graphic novels, film/TV, additional sub-cultures, etc. ... each with it's own _instigator_
  - each sub-team under the instigator/custodian can apply for funding from the treasury through community voting to produce the project and/or raise their own funds
- write the Joe Sputnik Chronicles (shorts & novels) _in public_
  - write 5,000 words per day ... livestreamed and/or "daily pages" for funders/holders only, and with their feedback
  - pulp style writing => ???
  - crowdsourced writing, editing, imagery, layout, publication, promotion
- gamification ->
  - introduce a CCG type NFT collection (#5, above) where players can use their NFT to "battle" others, trading, collecting, etc.
  - holding or minting a specific character allows them to instigate new stories for that character ... for example, someone who owns an NFT for a small player can write, draw, or commission a story that features the character(s) they hold (and are custodians of); if done well and the story sells, the value (hit points) of the character, and therefore the individual NFT) grows ... _holder control of value_
- community pen name(s) and complete contributor lists in the book ... contribute in any significant way and get mentioned in the Acknowledgements
- IMMERSIVE STORYTELLING ... in the Sputnik metaverse
  - _what if ..._ you were inside the protagonist watching the movie unfold?
- METAVERSE -> how do you, รก la THE IMMERSION EFFECT, take what happens IN the metaverse OUT into the (so-called ... philosophy of reality!) world?
