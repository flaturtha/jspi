          No. 1 &mdash; The Joe Sputnik Chronicles
        </h2>
        <p>He was still dead.</p>
        <p>But, somehow, that hadn’t stopped him from fucking up my day.</p>
        <p>
          Or the wall of the reception area of my office cum living quarters and
          filling the air with an acrid iron odor. It was going to take hours of
          scrubbing to clean the blood and brain matter off the wall. And more
          than a few coats of paint to cover the red stain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t know why I expected him to be gone after I’d found him there
          this morning. Or how he’d gotten here without my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>How out of it had I been to not hear the shotgun blast?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          All I remember was stumbling in during the wee hours after days on
          stakeout. Wasted days watching the wrong suspect. But that was another
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guy was a more immediate one. But he hadn’t moved in the few
          hours after I’d discovered him and gone to see Mr. Bishop about my
          failed surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>So I shrugged and started to step past him.</p>
        <p>
          “Mr. Sputnik?” A soft, almost lilting voice but with a smoker’s finish
          from the doorway behind me. “Mr. Joe Sputnik? The PI?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused, my right foot hovering above his head. Or where his head
          should have been if it weren’t splattered on my reception area wall.
        </p>
        <p>I set it back down. But I didn’t turn. I waited for the scream.</p>
        <p>“Are you Mr. Sputnik?” she asked again. Then, “Oh!”</p>
        <p>I turned and tried to be nonchalant.</p>
        <p>
          “Yes,” I said, sticking out a welcoming hand with the usual oversized
          smile that seemed to go with the glad-hand. After all, any business
          was good business. But then it was my turn to say, “Oh!”
        </p>
        <p>
          In the shadow of my doorway, the rare Spring sun shining through the
          filthy hallway window cast a yellow, powdery beam, obscuring a sinewy
          figure in harsh shadow. A hip, a leg. A silhouette of …
        </p>
        <p>“A … Audrey …” I stammered.</p>
        <p>
          She was willowy, lean. Wearing a skin tight dress; floor length but
          slit to her hip. And split at the waist, her midriff naked.
        </p>
        <p>
          And a long leg jutting out into the sunbeam, laced with an intricate
          tattoo. Above, her gloved arm was similarly painted. And a shock of
          rusty hair was caught by the sunbeam.
        </p>
        <p>She slithered into the room and into the full sunbeam.</p>
        <p>“My name is Marionette,” she said, taking my limp hand.</p>
        <p>Without command, my hand clenched around her’s.</p>
        <p>
          <em>A Moth,</em> I told myself.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          She sat on the edge of the cracked, leather, former library chair I’d
          rescued from some dumpster years ago. Not out of disgust for its
          condition; I sure she was used to this level of quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If it still qualifies for that moniker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Her poise was part practiced but not quite correct. A common
          streetwalker trying to be elegant. She missed. They all did.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But was it any worse than … ?</em> I shrugged at the thought. Not
          worth the brain cells.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other part of her poise was an attempt to hold back emotion but
          the blotchiness of her face, the red explosions of color under her
          winter-white skin told of the turmoil inside.
        </p>
        <p>“God!” she said. “Freddie. I … I …”</p>
        <p>
          She looked up from her hands still wringing my only clean hanky, no
          longer clean. Wet. A tinge of crimson.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced at my office window but the sun wasn’t shining in this
          direction yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mr. Sputnik, I came here to ask for your help finding Freddie. After,
          well. After.” A pause and sniffle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Real tears? An act?</em> I couldn’t be sure.
        </p>
        <p>“Go on,” was all I said.</p>
        <p>
          “You see, Mr. Sputnik, Freddie is, was, my … my business manager. I’m
          an entertainer. Not like those other girls. I …,” she leaned close. “I
          auditioned with them, y’know. About two weeks ago. No word yet but
          Freddie told me that it takes time for …”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Poor disillusioned girl.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked the part. Almost. But the Painted Ladies were the elite of
          the elite. Of the elite. Bred for the role, you might say.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>You’d know, you chump,</em> said that annoying voice in the back
          of my mind that likes to dredge up old, bad memories.{" "}
          <em>Why never good memories?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          “… and I may not be …” she was still talking. But not about the dead
          guy in my reception area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Poor disillusioned, deluded girl.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I held up a hand.</p>
        <p>
          “Your, uhm, business manager? The guy …” I jabbed my head that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh, sorry!” she said without taking a breath.{" "}
          <em>Maybe she did have special talents.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the staccato sound of a machine gun, “Freddie came to me about a
          month ago. He had a new business venture but he needed my help. I was
          flattered, of course, because he never said it like that before. I
          mean, I was always part of his business doings but never because I was
          needed but this time Freddie said that it couldn’t succeed without me
          because the deal required a woman. A special woman, he said.”
        </p>
        <p>Finally, a pause.</p>
        <p>“Me.”</p>
        <p>
          I didn’t realize she’d stopped talking until I heard the sound of a
          garbage truck rumbling down the alleyway three floors below.{" "}
          <em>Hit the damn bins again. Idiot!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared at her for another few moments but it was clear she was done.
          Or thought she was.
        </p>
        <p>“What did he want you to do?”</p>
        <p>
          She bounced out of the old leather library chair and yanked her top
          almost over her head, bearing supple breasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Too small for a boob job.</em>
        </p>
        <p>“See?” she jabbed her sternum.</p>
        <p>
          Then I saw it; running down her sternum, between her small, perky
          breasts was a fresh tattoo. A few weeks old. Still a tinge of
          inflammation, like some weird glow around the edges. But mostly
          healed.
        </p>
        <p>I leaned in. I cocked my head. I leaned back.</p>
        <p>
          The ink was iridescent. Black but with a shimmer when the light hit it
          at different angles. And it was both in her skin, like a traditional
          tattoo, and on it. Like ink that was still wet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The symbols were strange. Angular. Mechanical. Not letters but in some
          way reminiscent of Japanese kanji. Vaguely familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Pretty, isn’t it?” Then, “And just rub your finger along it. Feels …
          alive!”
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t have to run my finger along her tattoo to feel how the
          special ink felt. It was a texture and a sensation I was very familiar
          with. Even if it had been a decade or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved around from the front on my desk and slumped into my desk
          chair. I stared at the tattooed young woman across from me, still
          holding her top above her breasts.
        </p>
        <p>I motioned for her to pull it back down.</p>
        <p>
          “Why?” I asked, leaning forward as she settled back into the old
          leather chair.
        </p>
        <p>“Why?”</p>
        <p>“I asked first.”</p>
        <p>She giggled. “You remind me of Freddie.”</p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          Freddie hadn’t told her why. Just that it was critical. He’d bought
          her the new dress …
        </p>
        <p>“He spent, like, a thousand on it!” she said.</p>
        <p>
          … and took her to the Japanese enclave on the island. Somehow, he’d
          managed to get a pass for the two of them to cross the East River and
          Marionette found herself in the strange dark streets of the upper east
          side in Yorktown, near E 86th. A place I was all too familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>“A dingy alley …”</p>
        <p>
          But the nearly blind old man who ran the shop gave her tea and settled
          her onto the reed mat at the rear of the shop. Then set to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’d never had the old skool tattoo before,” Marionette told me. “I
          thought it would hurt.”
        </p>
        <p>“The tea,” I told her. “It numbs the brain and the pain.”</p>
        <p>
          The shisho had completed the tattoo, as per the instructions Freddie
          had given him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Strange,</em> I thought as I leaned in a doorway a few shops away
          from the tattooist’s shop and watched through the constant downpour.
          Freddie managed a pass into Manhattan. He’d managed to fool the old
          man into tattooing a Moth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            But how? Why? And why the strange design. Definitely not
            traditional.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Around me, the bustle of the Japanese enclave whirled. The alley was
          as crowded as a crosstown bus. Locals, businessmen and women shopping
          or slumming.
        </p>
        <p>Cries of vendors. The toxic aroma of food carts.</p>
        <p>
          It whirled around me like fireflies. Streaks of light. Flashes of
          color. Blurs of activity.
        </p>
        <p>But I saw none of it.</p>
        <p>
          I stood in the rear doorway of yet another restaurant. And watched the
          doorway of the shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t check my watch but I knew they would be coming out soon.
          Adding color to the butterfly outline of a newly minted Painted Lady
          took only so much time. And that time was about up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three hours earlier, I’d seen the darting eyes from under the brim of
          his hat before I’d seen the young woman on his arm. For a moment, my
          brain again screamed, <em>Audrey …</em> when I saw her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Marionette, she had a shock of red hair that rolled over her bare
          shoulders; and eyes I thought I recognized. As she turned and stepped
          through the shisho’s doorway, I saw the outline between her shoulder
          blades.
        </p>
        <p>
          A butterfly. A swallowtail. But just the barest outline. That meant
          she’d completed her training and gaining her colors today meant she
          had accomplished her first assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goon that accompanied her stood outside, blocking the doorway.
          That was fine with me; I had no plans to enter and risk being
          recognized. My investigation could wait.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>My time estimation was dead on.</p>
        <p>
          The girl emerged from the doorway and took her Shadow’s arm. After his
          guarded gaze up and down the alleyway, they turned and moved through
          the throng.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they passed me, I pressed deeper into the darkness. But the neon
          light above the food cart opposite illuminated the tattoo. It was
          uncovered; tradition and technique. And blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A blue swallowtail. Rare.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I wondered who this girl was, so marked with the rarest of
          butterflies. And the rarest of colors. Someone destined for a great
          role in society.
        </p>
        <p>But that was hardly my problem.</p>
        <p>
          I waited a moment, watching the pair move through the dancing colored
          shadows from the lights on vendors’ carts and the small storefront
          windows.
        </p>
        <p>Then I stepped into the light towards the tattoo shop.</p>
        <p>
          I was still caught by the blue butterfly on the girl’s back and hadn’t
          checked for traffic. I smacked into an oncoming truck.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truck turned out to be the massive chest belonging to a face I
          knew but didn’t want to see. Two large arms shoved me aside back into
          the shadow of my doorway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jackboot didn’t pause, but he glanced at me, his eyes matching the
          snarl on his lips.
        </p>
        <p>“Move off! Regiment business.”</p>
        <p>And he marched on. Straight into the tattoo shop.</p>
        <p>
          As I breathed out and leaned against the doorway again, I wiped my
          brow. There had been no recognition in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            There are advantages to being persona non grata and assumed to be
            dead or drunk in a ditch, somewhere. Somewhere not here.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But what was he up to? Why would Hans be here? Why would he go into
          that shop? He never came here. It was below his rank and position.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rechecked the traffic patterns but found only ordinary people. I
          pushed into the flow and, despite being battered a bit downstream,
          managed to make my way across and onto the steps of the old tattoo
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I checked the surroundings and leaned my shoulder into the door,
          pushing it open a crack until I could hear Han’s baritone voice. It
          was no more than a whisper but it echoed in the tiny shop and demanded
          answers to a question I hadn’t heard, but could guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          “その男は適切な身分証明書と書類を持っていた。 || Sono otoko wa
          tekisetsuna mibun shōmei-sho to shorui o motte ita,” came the old
          man’s voice. Soft, but commanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t give a damn if he had the right paperwork,” grunted Hans.
          “The gakubori you gave the girl was not meant for her. The piece of
          shit Bishop screwed us. Sold us out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “ハンスさん、何卒ごめんなさい。 || Hansu-san, nanitozo gomen’nasai.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I could sense that man’s deep bow, indicating contrition. Yet his
          voice was tinged with distaste for the man who questioned him. Hans
          held a certain status but the old man was, as Marionette had said,{" "}
          <em>old skool</em>. Like the old Samurai code but that of the ichimon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sniggered at the beneath-the-breath comments the old man had made
          years before about Hans and was certain his opinion had not changed.
          At least not for the better.
        </p>
        <p>But Hans was speaking.</p>
        <p>“… she wants to see you. To discuss this matter.”</p>
        <p>
          “彼女は大歓迎です。 || Kanojo wa dai kangeidesu.” Again, the meaning
          of the old man’s words hidden behind his words.
        </p>
        <p>“No. Not here. Come. She’s waiting.”</p>
        <p>
          I thought I heard the old man curse but I also heard the sound of his
          bamboo cane tapping on the rice mats so I slipped back into the
          rushing flow of humanity washing along the dingy alleyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The throng swept me along but I pulled out of its current near the
          edge of the alley before I fell into the light of the street and the
          streaked headlights of traffic limping along E 86th, strobing in the
          rain.
        </p>
        <p>Behind me, I saw Hans pushing the old man ahead of him.</p>
        <p>
          Unlike the Shadow and the young Painted Lady who had weaved through
          the crowd, Hans marched up the center of the alley, shoving his quarry
          before him, while the bodies seemed to separate and create a path as
          if by magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But it was fear, not magic.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A black sedan idled at the main street and the old shisho was bundled
          inside. Hans landed in the front seat next to the driver; the old
          shisho alone in the back as far as I could see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the car moved off into the rain. And I saw her through the half
          opened window. This time it wasn’t my imagination.
        </p>
        <p>“Audrey.”</p>

        <p>
          Ever since Mr. Bishop contacted me and asked me to follow a man he
          suspected was stealing from him, I’d felt an odd dullness in my gut.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I’d been seeing her everywhere I looked. I knew it was just some
          weird quirk of imagination, probably brought on by bad sushi. Or just
          my mind playing tricks on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there she was. Sitting in the back of the sedan. With the shisho
          next to her.
        </p>
        <p>The dullness turned to a sickening pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>God, I hate Manhattan.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the sedan shoved its way into traffic and edged its way to the next
          corner, I stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch it go. Not that I
          didn’t know exactly where it was headed.
        </p>
        <p>
          North two blocks, then towards Midtown. And south to the opulent manor
          that overlooked the grand lawns of Central Park, on the west side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a step in the same direction, thought better of it when a
          delicate hand brushed my sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Not tonight, honey. I’m afraid I’m booked,” I told the girl. A common
          “entertainer”, as Marionette called them. Not even a Month.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned and headed back to the alley and the old tattoo shop. At the
          corner, I paused and let my eyes wash over the masses. Just ordinary
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I adjusted my own hat down over my eyes, tugged at the collar of my
          greatcoat … both smelling of mothballs … and strode down the alley,
          letting myself into the shop.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          It was a simple place. A small Buddha statue near the door. The floor
          covered with rice mats. A few red embroidered pillows against the
          walls. A waiting area. Somewhere, a stick of incense burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sage. Or, dragon’s blood.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond, a beaded curtain led to the back of the shop, where the shisho
          performed his magic. I stood holding the beaded curtain aside and let
          my eyes search the small room. A collection of white, odorless candles
          burned on a small table near the back wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single white cushion sat next to a thicker rice mat. Body length.
          Where the girls, the shudai, lay when the master was tattooing.
          Collected next to the mat were the tools of his trade … the nomi and
          the hanibori. Pots of his unique inks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My left hand held the curtain; my right brushed across my chest as the
          memory of my own session under the master’s hand rippled through my
          mind, bringing with it the <em>tok-tok</em> sound and the stinging
          pain of the bone needles entering my skin.
        </p>
        <p>Shadows were not given the tea.</p>
        <p>
          The room was otherwise decorated with traditional Japanese art …
          watercolor landscapes and elegant writing. I understood enough of the
          kanji to recognize sayings of the Buddha.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was nothing else. Nothing to tell me what Marionette’s
          tattoo meant or why Freddie has somehow conned the old man into giving
          a sacred tattoo to a Moth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing that told me the why of the strange, inorganic, almost
          mechanical markings on Marionette’s chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            How did you fool him, Freddie, into thinking she was a Painted Lady?
            It’d take more than an expensive dress.
          </em>{" "}
          Then, <em>Hans …</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The brass bell above the door clanged as it opened, interrupting my
          thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned and saw a young man, Japanese, enter. He nodded to me, then
          set a small package on the floor just inside and slipped back out into
          the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The package was a small bundle of papers, neatly wrapped in a bow. I
          scooped them up and, peering out through the blinds into the whirl of
          activity outside, leafed through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One caught my eye. It was a small envelope made from old rice paper.
          Yellow with age. In the upper left corner was a mark.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sonofabitch!</em>
        </p>
        <p>It was the same mark as the top symbol of Marionette’s tattoo.</p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          The door to my office was open. Just an inch or two. But I had closed
          it and locked it before I went out. And given Marionette instructions
          not to leave or let anyone in. Just in case Freddie’s executioners
          came back looking for her and her enigmatic tattoo.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I have the only key,” I told her, and showed her where to hide if
          someone tried to come in before I got back. “I’ll knock twice. Pause,
          then twice more so you’ll know it’s me.”
        </p>
        <p>But the door was open. Not broken. Picked.</p>
        <p>
          <em>How the hell do you pick a Barnsdorf Biolock?</em> Well, I already
          knew the answer to that question. It wasn’t a <em>how</em>. It was a{" "}
          <em>who</em>. And a who I didn’t want to think about. Not today. Not
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached into my belt and wrapped my fingers around the grip of my
          gun but left it tucked. With my other hand, I eased the door open and
          swept the room with my eyes. Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, nothing but the dead guy still on the floor. I was going to have
          to do something with him. Easy enough in this neighborhood. But a
          chore that needed doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stepped inside and edged along the outer wall, my eyes pinned on my
          office door. The desk lamp was on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Good.</em> I’d left it on.
        </p>
        <p>I crouched behind my receptionist’s desk.</p>
        <p>
          <em>One of these days, I’ll have to get a receptionist.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I waited. Watched. Nothing.</p>
        <p>
          I duck walked from behind the desk and leaned against the outer wall
          of my office next to the door. I pushed up from my squat and looked
          for a silhouette against the lamplight inside.
        </p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>I eased open the door.</p>
        <p>Half stooped, I eased into the room.</p>
        <p>Still nothing.</p>
        <p>
          Then I lunged, tackling my library chair and rolling off to crouch
          below the window. As I rolled, I pulled my gun from my belt and let
          the barrel sweep over the room.
        </p>
        <p>“Got a license for that thing?”</p>
        <p>
          The voice was deep, a drawl with a clipped ending to the words. A
          weird deep south and Jamaican accent, with a tinge of an aristocratic
          Brit.
        </p>
        <p>I cursed. Just once.</p>
        <p>
          Then I pushed myself to my feet and stood. The gun dropped onto my
          desk as the giant Jamaican stepped out of the back bedroom into the
          light. He was puffing on a cigarillo.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You got a license for that?” I asked as he blew smoke rings into my
          office.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment we just stared at each other. Then, he dropped the
          cheroot onto my floor and ground it out with his heel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scooped my gun into the top desk drawer and he belly laughed as he
          slumped into the old leather chair.
        </p>
        <p>“What are you doing here, Barnes?”</p>
        <p>“Official police business.”</p>
        <p>I glanced at the doorway to my reception area.</p>
        <p>“I have no idea who that is.”</p>
        <p>“Naturally.”</p>
        <p>“He was here when I woke up this morning.”</p>
        <p>
          “And, of course, you immediately called your local precinct to report
          him.”
        </p>
        <p>“I’ll get around to it. Not like he’s going anywhere.”</p>
        <p>Barnes shrugged.</p>
        <p>“Not my jurisdiction.”</p>
        <p>“Dead bodies aren’t your jurisdiction, detective?”</p>
        <p>“Lieutenant Inspector. Manhattan.”</p>
        <p>“Big promotion. Congratulations.”</p>
        <p>Again, he shrugged. Then looked around my office.</p>
        <p>“And you …”</p>
        <p>“It’s a living.”</p>
        <p>“Better than being dead?”</p>
        <p>My turn to shrug.</p>
        <p>
          Again, we stared at each other. Daring the other to speak. To say …
          something after so many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, “Actually, I’m here on customs business. Seems someone
          reported seeing you in Manhattan this evening. And yet, I found no
          pass in your name.”
        </p>
        <p>A pause.</p>
        <p>“Care to explain?”</p>
        <p>
          <em>Not really.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But I didn’t say anything out loud. I just dropped into my office
          chair and kicked up my feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Been on a stakeout for the last few days. Up in Queens. Utter waste
          of time. Then, after I woke up this morning and found …” I nodded
          towards Freddie in the outer room, “… I went to see my client and
          report.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Barnes didn’t react or ask any more questions. He just stared at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, I smiled, recognizing his favorite interrogation technique
          designed to keep a suspect talking for fear of the empty silence. I
          knew the technique and it wasn’t going to get me to say anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          “But my client, a Mr. Bishop, wasn’t in. As usual. In fact, I’ve never
          even met the guy. Just a go-between. Some lackie named Lucas. But …” I
          dropped my feet off the desk and leaned forward. “The office where I’d
          met this twig a few days ago was empty. Like it hadn’t been occupied
          in a decade.”
        </p>
        <p>“Your client was a Mr. Bishop?”</p>
        <p>
          <em>Damn.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I flopped back into my chair. And nodded.</p>
        <p>“Why? Know him?”</p>
        <p>
          “A Mr. Bishop, of the Upper West Side, and a member of society, jumped
          from his penthouse balcony this evening.”
        </p>
        <p>He waited for my reaction.</p>
        <p>“About the time you were said to have been seen in Manhattan.”</p>
        <p>
          I held my breath. There had to be more than a few Mr. Bishops running
          around. One less than this morning, sure. But this guy couldn’t be my
          guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Or could it?</em>
        </p>
        <p>“Why would I kill him?”</p>
        <p>“So you were in Manhattan?”</p>
        <p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>
        <p>
          He shrugged and pushed his bulk onto his feet and pulled a cigar case
          from his inner breast pocket. He selected one, dropped it on my desk,
          then popped another into his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood and stared at me for several seconds, his practiced gaze
          unblinking. Then he cupped his hands around the small cigar and lit
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mr. Bishop … the dead one … is rumored to have been connected. Into
          some questionable things. Even for that bunch. If it is the same guy
          who hired you, I’d watch out if I were you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned and took two long steps to my office doorway. He paused as
          he looked at the body laying on my reception room floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Be a good idea to call this in before he gets too ripe. Shame about
          the wall.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he dug into his pocket and rolled something over in his fingers a
          moment before tossing it across to me. It bounced on my desk and
          skittered into the corner of my office.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That was in his pocket,” Barnes called over his shoulder as he
          stepped past the body. “Old friend of yours, perhaps?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I picked up the spare cheroot he’d left and twirled it in my fingers.
          I heard the outer door click shut and felt myself breathing again. I
          glanced into the shadows where the coin had come to rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I stood. Stepped from behind the desk and pulled a book off the
          shelf.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>click</em> and the bookshelf crept away from the wall on one
          side, revealing what had once been a wet bar but now served as my
          secret tiny room.
        </p>
        <p>I pulled it open, expecting to see a girl waiting for me.</p>
        <p>It was empty.</p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>But it wasn’t empty.</p>
        <p>On the counter against the far wall, a folded scrap of paper.</p>
        <p>“Dear Mr. Sputnik,” it started. From Marionette.</p>
        <p>
          “You’ll never guess … but I just got a call from the doyenne at the
          great house. They have reviewed my application and want to formally
          interview me at their place in the Hamptons. Tonight.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I could almost hear the giggle in her voice as she’d written the note.
        </p>
        <p>“Hamptons?” I said aloud.</p>
        <p>
          The Painted Ladies didn’t have any property in the Hamptons. Just the
          sprawling acres near the Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Poor stupid, disillutioned, deluded girl. The Painted Ladies don’t
            want you …
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But someone did. And someone had used her application as a ruse to get
          her to come to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Why waste good shoe leather when you can get your quarry to come to
            you?
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>I crumbled up the note and leaned against the doorframe.</p>
        <p>
          “The Hamptons,” I said again and was lost in a haze. A stormy night in
          a beach house closed off for the winter. Audrey. The night we … and
          the mafia thugs who tried to kill us. Nearly twenty years ago. My ribs
          still ached from the beating.
        </p>
        <p>I uncrumpled Marionette’s note. No address.</p>
        <p>
          Then I remembered the letter from the old tattooist’s shop. The
          postmark was Montauk. The Hamptons.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          It was past midnight by the time the train dropped me at the Montauk
          station. An agonizing three hour ride from the Bronx station. I’d
          spent the ride staring at the coin Barnes had found in Freddie’s
          pocket.
        </p>
        <p>A Regiment challenge coin. And one of a high ranking official.</p>
        <p>
          <em>How did you get a hold of this, Freddie?</em>
        </p>
        <p>I figured one of three possibilities:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            he’d stolen it … after all, Freddie wasn’t exactly Regiment
            material; more accurately, he was the scum they wiped off the bottom
            of their boots;
          </li>
          <li>
            he had acquired it as part of his “business venture”, either given
            it by a high ranking contact or dupe, or back to option 1;
          </li>
          <li>he was a Regiment goon, under cover.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I mulled the options. My first thought seemed most likely. Then again,
          those guys were skilled at infiltration of what they considered
          “questionable” groups. Basically, anyone who wasn’t them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second option seemed almost as likely. If Freddie were what he
          appeared to be … a second rate pimp and con man … then it stood to
          reason that, either he’d conned some Regiment official into providing
          him with some secret information and the coin or he’d stolen it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Or an undercover …</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          That idea made me sick. But it was well within their normal modus
          operandi. Infiltrate. Confuse. Destroy. It was practically a Regiment
          motto.
        </p>
        <p>
          But which option got his head blown off by a shotgun in my office?
          While I was asleep in the back room. Why hadn’t I heard it? And why
          hadn’t Freddie’s killer given me the same treatment?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Regiment? Whoever Freddie conned? His contact to sell whatever
          that secret that tattoo held?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hans wouldn’t have thought twice about killing me or ordering his
          Regiment goons to do the deed. But saddling me with a dead body would
          be better revenge in his warped mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what about the mysterious Mr. Bishop and the twig of a man I’d met
          with when I was hired. Lucas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Lucas.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          He could have been Freddie’s twin. Skinnier. Less intelligent.
          Definitely not a Regiment operative.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Mr. Bishop. Just a name thrown at me to get me on the hook? Or was
          the suicide the same man? Was it suicide?
        </p>
        <p>
          “The gakubori you gave the girl was not meant for her. The piece of
          shit Bishop screwed us. Sold us out.” Hans’ words to the old man
          echoed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was Bishop connected to Freddie? Was he the one who gave Freddie the
          coin? Willingly or because he bought into Freddie’s con?
        </p>
        <p>
          And Marionette? Ultimately innocent? A willing part of Freddie’s con?
          Or just a foolish Moth who dreamed of being something more than she
          could ever be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Too many questions. Not enough answers. And I was racing off to try
          and rescue that silly girl.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pressed deep into the hard seat of the train car, my back to the
          locomotive, and I watched the brilliant, neon lights of Manhattan fade
          into the gloom of the night. But the further away it dropped into that
          darkness, the closer I felt to its shadow.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          No cabs ran this time of night in Montauk. Not like the City where an
          app, a tap, and you had a ride wherever. So I walked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Montauk sits on the far eastern edge of Long Island. Far from the
          bustle of the inner sanctum of Manhattan where the ultra-rich and
          powerful live and conduct business.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small hamlet. A sleepy fishing village. But rimmed with the
          sprawling country homes of the same ultra-rich. Their weekend
          getaways.
        </p>
        <p>Manhattan is loud. Crowded. Filled with lights and activity.</p>
        <p>Montauk is quiet. Isolated. Dark.</p>
        <p>I hadn’t been out this far in twenty years.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Not since …</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But I managed to find my way along the dark road that wandered through
          the countryside outside the hamlet itself. I didn’t have an address
          but I had a feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marionette had said she was going to the great house in the Hamptons.
          That could only mean one location. Sure, this end of the Hamptons was
          filled with sprawling estates. But there was only one great house.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I knew exactly where it was at the end of a long, dark road. On
          the very tip of Montauk Point.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          The great house, as it was called by anyone who’d seen it or been
          inside, sat on a bluff above the beach on Montauk Point. Years ago,
          the entire estate had been a state park but some shady deal shifted
          ownership to the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Yeah, that family.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d been a guest here once. With Audrey. Maybe they wouldn’t remember
          me. If they did, this was going to be a short visit.
        </p>
        <p>It was probably going to be a short visit anyway.</p>
        <p>
          But security would be tight and I wasn’t dressed for burglary, so I
          stood at the front gate and waited as the guard looked me over.
        </p>
        <p>“What the hell are you?”</p>
        <p>“Freddie. I believe your bosses are expecting me.”</p>
        <p>
          He grunted and stepped away to speak into his radio. After an argument
          with the other end, he yanked open the pedestrian gate and jerked his
          head towards the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Follow the main drive to the house. Someone will meet you at the
          front entrance. The girl’s already inside.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Thanks, chum,” I said, patting him on the shoulder and sauntering up
          the gravel drive as I imagined an overconfident conman like Freddie
          would.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drive curved to the right and soon the fir trees that flanked each
          side gave way to a view of the great house.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Lives up to its name.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I couldn’t see the entire front of the house. It was lost
          beyond the trees in both directions. But the main entrance was my
          destination anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Da boss said you wasn’t comin’, Freddie.” The man in the overstuffed
          suit was silhouetted against the warm interior light.
        </p>
        <p>I shrugged.</p>
        <p>“My business in Manhattan was, uh, cut short.”</p>
        <p>The mook guffawed.</p>
        <p>“Yeah, we heard Mr. Bishop had to fly!”</p>
        <p>
          I watched his back for a breath as he turned, just laughing at his
          joke and went inside before following him into the Italian tiled front
          entryway.
        </p>
        <p>“Wait here.”</p>
        <p>
          I stepped down into the grand ballroom that seemed to take up the
          entire center of the great house. I’d need a moving sidewalk to get
          across the black and white checkered tile floor to the enormous
          staircase that rose up to the second floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my eyes followed the grand stairs, they met another pair of eyes.
          Dark. Bloodshot.
        </p>
        <p>
          They belonged to a tall man in a cream colored suit who leaned on the
          railing at the top of the grand staircase. Another face I recognized.
        </p>
        <p>“You ain’t Freddie,” he said.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Woops!</em>
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          It wasn’t the fact that they poured over cloth that covered my face
          that bothered me. It was the fact that it was just short of boiling
          and I’d been stripped to my waist and was being held down on a cold
          metal table in a room that must have been a meat locker.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hot water dropped forty degrees the moment it hit my face and the
          cloth. From searing hot to aching cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sputtered and coughed as the water forced its way into my mouth and
          down my throat. It filled my lungs, which spasmed and coughed it back
          up again.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That is enough,” came a voice far away. Or maybe near. I couldn’t
          tell. Like the water, it was boiling hot in a freezing room. “Let him
          up. Dry him off. I think our Mr. Sputnik will be willing to talk to us
          now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If I’d expected a gentle toweling off, I would be sorely disappointed.
          Instead, my torn shirt was tossed in my face and I was dragged off the
          metal table.
        </p>
        <p>“And bring him to my office. A better place for a chat, I think.”</p>
        <p>
          Minutes later, I was dumped onto a supple leather couch in a home
          office that was larger and certainly more plushly decored than my
          entire office/living quarters.
        </p>
        <p>I edged towards the end of the couch closest to the fireplace.</p>
        <p>“Care for a cognac? It will warm you after your ordeal.”</p>
        <p>
          I took the snifter and drained it. The liquor burned as it rushed down
          into my empty stomach and I felt its glow begin to warm me. But there
          was a bitter after taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yes,” came the man’s voice as I looked into my empty glass. “A shame
          to spoil the taste but it really is not a good year.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well,” I said, holding it out for a refill. “No need to waste the
          good stuff on a dead man.”
        </p>
        <p>He chuckled as he poured another dram.</p>
        <p>
          “It won’t kill you, my friend. Although, before the night is out, you
          may well wish it had. It will just help facilitate our conversation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I gulped my portion and tried to balance the empty glass on the sofa
          arm. It wasn’t to be. But I was feeling warm again and there was a
          fire that burned in my gut. Not just from the booze.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen, bub,” I said, jabbing a finger towards my host, “You torture
          me. You fill me with some kind of poison. Worse, you give me cut rate
          booze. It’s as if you think I wouldn’t be completely honest with ya.
          Try me!”
        </p>
        <p>
          He seemed bemused and poured himself a snifter from a different
          bottle. Then swirled it and held it up to the light.
        </p>
        <p>“You already lied to me, Mr. Sputnik.”</p>
        <p>I crinkled my nose and squinted at him.</p>
        <p>
          “You told my man at the gate that you were Freddie. And that is simply
          not true. How, then, could I expect you to tell me anything else but
          lies?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>He had a point.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Look, I just came for the girl. She’s innocent. Just another one of
          Freddie’s dupes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ah, the young lady. How gallant. And here I thought that dashing
          heroes racing off to save damsels in distress all died off a century
          ago.”
        </p>
        <p>He sniffed his cognac before continuing.</p>
        <p>
          “You know, I am inclined to let you take her. She has, after all,
          served her purpose. She is of no further use to us. We have what
          Freddie acquired for us.”
        </p>
        <p>“The tattoo?”</p>
        <p>He smiled.</p>
        <p>
          “Indeed. Well, not the tattoo itself. It is … insignificant. Merely a
          vessel. And you, my dear detective, have supplied us with the
          remaining clue. The solution.”
        </p>
        <p>Again, I squinted at him.</p>
        <p>“Huh?” was all I managed.</p>
        <p>He reached behind him and tapped a button on the desk.</p>
        <p>“Bring the young lady.”</p>
        <p>
          Then he picked up something and examined it under the lamp on his
          desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The challenge coin.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          “When Freddie disappeared, we worried that this had been lost. Without
          it, the tattoo’s message was obscured.”
        </p>
        <p>“A key? To a puzzle message in the tattoo?”</p>
        <p>
          “Yes,” he said as the door behind me opened and the mook I’d met at
          the front door walked in, with his hand wrapped around Marionette’s
          bicep. “I really should reward you and the young lady for bringing
          both pieces of the message. With Freddie and Mr. Bishop dead, I do not
          have to pay out the quarter million.”
        </p>
        <p>“Mr. Sputnik?!”</p>
        <p>
          She broke free and rushed over to the couch, throwing herself onto my
          lap and her arms around my neck. Wet lips squashed mine and I was
          reminded of the waterboarding torture I’d just experienced.
        </p>
        <p>This was nicer.</p>
        <p>
          But then the mook pulled her away and dropped her into an overstuff,
          but still new oversized leather library chair.
        </p>
        <p>She landed with a grunt and a glare at the mook. But then …</p>
        <p>
          “Oh, Mr. Sputnik, ain’t it wonderful? I passed the audition. They
          liked my tattoo …”
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, I was certain she was going to display it for us all.
          Then the mook slapped her.
        </p>
        <p>“Shad up!”</p>
        <p>“Sorry, babe,” I said.</p>
        <p>
          She looked confused. But still with that smile of blissful ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Indeed, my dear,” said the man in the cream suit. “I am afraid that
          we have deceived you. We, regrettably, have nothing to do with the
          Painted Ladies.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me for a moment and I wasn’t sure if it was recognition
          or just a look to intimidate me. Either way, I was stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You got what you wanted. Whatever it is. So, let us go. We’ll be no
          bother.” I started to rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door kicked in and a gaunt man I’d known as Lucas ran into the
          room, breathless.
        </p>
        <p>“Boss. At the front gate. Gunfire. Regiment.”</p>
        <p>
          The mook drew an oversized piece from his ill-fitting suit and lunged
          towards the door. Lucas paused, looking at his boss, then followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man in the cream suit glared at me. I shook my head but he reached
          into his coat and pulled out a small handgun. But he didn’t point it
          at me. Instead, without taking his eyes off me, he extended his arm
          towards Marionette and fired.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was still smiling, not understanding what the man told her about
          his subterfuge or her role in Freddie’s con game. She was still
          smiling as she slumped back into the oversized leather library chair,
          a bullet hole in her forehead and a small trickle of blood running
          down her pale face.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Poor disillusioned girl.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As machine gun fire reached our ears from the front drive, mixed with
          curses and cries, and his gaze left me, I launched myself at the man
          in the cream colored suit, catching him mid chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard his small automatic cough once and then clatter on the
          hardwood floor of his opulent office. But I didn’t stop. I punched and
          clawed at his face as we rolled over the heavy oak desk, crashed into
          his high back leather office chair and landed on the window seat
          overlooking the back lawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was on top but he kneed me in the nuts and I doubled up, rolling off
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was faster to his feet and landed an Italian loafer in my gut. I
          collided with the high back chair and fell behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, on the floor inches from my head was the coin. I rolled to my
          stomach and grabbed it. From my prone position, I saw his hand
          reaching for the automatic beneath the desk. I decided it was more
          expeditious to excuse myself before he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kicking to my feet, I picked up a heavy bronze statue from next to the
          window seat and heaved it at the leaded windows that overlooked the
          sprawling lawn. Then followed it. Whether the statue broke the glass
          or I did, I wasn’t sure.
        </p>
        <p>But I was through and falling through the darkness.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Damn.</em> I thought as I saw the lawn before and below me.
          <em>Second floor.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As I hit the thorn bushes below, I heard an explosion of machine gun
          fire from the room I’d just exited.{" "}
          <em>Hide in the bushes or take my chances on the open lawn?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I paused only long enough to stuff my fingers down my throat to force
          the tainted cognac back up before I ran for it.
        </p>
        <hr className="my-8 w-8/12 mx-auto" />
        <p>
          It was midafternoon before I managed to make my way the length of Long
          Island and back to my building in the Bronx. I waited across the
          street for half an hour, just to make sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the way seemed clear, so I slipped down the back alley, past the
          overturned garbage bins and climbed the fire escape. No need to make
          it too easy on anyone waiting upstairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hallway to my office door was empty and I slipped through the
          window; glad, once again, that the lock was terminally busted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced down the stairway as I passed then stopped dead in front of
          my door. It was closed. Locked. But an official looking envelope was
          stuck in the jam.
        </p>
        <p>I pulled it out and tore it open. It read:</p>
        <p className="mx-12">
          WARRANT. NOTICE TO APPEAR FOR QUESTIONING IN THE SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF
          MR. AUGUSTE BISHOP. MANHATTAN PRECINCT. APPEAR WITHIN THREE DAYS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stared at the words. Then stuffed the letter and envelope into my
          coat pocket and pushed inside.
        </p>
        <p>But Freddie’s body was gone, and the stain on my wall with him.</p>
        <p className="mt-12 text-center">THE END</p>
