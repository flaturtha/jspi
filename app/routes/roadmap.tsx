        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          In January of 2010, I found myself on a three plus week international
          trip for my job as editor and writer for a corporate magazine. It
          started in Dubai on New Years Eve and two weeks later, I sat in the
          lobby of my hotel in Cairo, Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was exhausted. Tired of the travel. The interviews. The constant
          focus on the task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>I needed a mental brake.</p>
        <p>
          So, I started fiddling with some fiction ideas and a character named
          Joe Sputnik introduced himself. He said he was a private detective.
          Like the classic characters of Dasheill Hammett and his ilk from the
          1940s and 1950s. But not in those throw-back days.
        </p>
        <p>My guy was a hardboiled PI in the future … the 2040s.</p>
        <p>
          So, over the next couple of years, I fiddled with the character, his
          story, and his world, filling not one but two composition notebooks
          with notes and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I sat down and wrote a draft of a novel that I called THE
          BUTTERFLY COLLECTOR. And published it chapter-by-chapter on my then
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, as life events changed and I moved on from that job to start my
          own publishing business, the novel sat in a desk drawer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mid-2020, as the pandemic grew, I found my publishing efforts and
          my freelance copywriting business cratering. Clients fleeing, afraid
          to spend marketing dollars when they felt their customers would not be
          spending.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I turned, once again, to fiction and wrote a series of novellas
          around a crazy, semi-immortal old British Army officer named Colonel
          Krill. I eventually wrote and published seven (so far) of the planned
          (eventually) sixty-four stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I published them on Amazon and tried my hand at Amazon ads but
          ultimately the stories had some issues (not written to market, needing
          better/to-market covers, etc.), so I stopped marketing them. Probably
          a mistake, but there it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through 2021, I worked on other stories and limped along picking up
          bits of freelance work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in December 2021, I started reading about how NFTs —
          non-fungible tokens — represented new possibilities for writers to
          fund their creativity.
        </p>
        <p>I was hooked.</p>
        <p>
          I also realized that my old friend Joe Sputnik was a perfect story to
          revamp against the decentralized world built on the back of the
          blockchain.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="my-8 mx-12 p-2 bg-white/90 text-black">
          <p>
            THEY SAY THAT THE GREATEST LIE SATAN EVER TOLD WAS THAT HE NEVER
            EXISTED
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the promise of a decentralized system — finance, business,
            commerce, goverment, religion — rose a darkness. An unexpected
            cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            But one so indisious, so hidden that most never even noticed. A
            darkness so complete that no one even suspected. Until it was too
            late …
          </p>
          <p>
            But one man caught a flash of the light and from that, felt the
            darkness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, against this darkness … against evil so ensconced that it is
            buried deep in the inner fabric that holds our world, our society
            together … against this thing stands one man.

          DECENTRALIZED STORYTELLING?

          First, a couple of links that explain the concepts better than I can.

            Read through those articles and you’ll get an idea of what I’m
            talking about. The guys at Bankless also recently posted a podcast
            episode where they talked about decentralized storytelling with the
            team from Shibuya, who are creating an animated series.

            Bankless — Decentralized Storytelling
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>In a nutshell, I see decentralized storytelling as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            open source and community-owned IPs for the characters and the story
            world
          </li>
          <li>
            what the Fantasy Hollywood article describes as “character DAOs”
          </li>
          <li>
            a collaborative storytelling system where creators tell independend
            stories within the defined universe (or metaverse) by
            minting/staking characters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In my view, community members can create new characters or “rent”
          characters from other stories and use them for new stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a take on a longstanding concept … that of <em>fan fiction.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fan fiction is when fans of a story or a character create their own
          stories using the characters. One of the biggest examples is the STAR
          WARS universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others include the Twitter accounts created by fans of the TV show
          MADMEN … fans tweeting <em>in character</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many large corporations that own and earn revenue from the
          intellectual property of these movie or television franchises, the
          idea of allowing fans to run with their own stories is terrifying.
        </p>
        <p className="italic">
          What if they twist a character into something we don’t want?
        </p>
        <p className="italic">What if they corrupt the storyline?</p>
        <p className="italic">
          What if they earn money from their stories … money that should be
          OURS?
        </p>
        <p>Relevant questions. But here’s a better one …</p>
        <p className="italic">
          What if we opened the doors to our characters, to our special worlds,
          and invited — with certain governance protocols — fans of our story
          into our community?
        </p>
        <p>
          That is what I imagine decentralized storytelling to be all about.

          The particulars of HOW to be worked out. Hopefully, with your input as
          part of my community.

        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">How I see it working</h3>
        <p>
          This is just my early understanding of DAOs, and web3 communities, as
          well as providing utility in my NFTs.

            key characters from the novel will be ultra-rares, while minor
            characters would be rare. Groups (such as Regiment goons or the

          </li>
          <li>
            each character would have various characteristics and{" "}
            <em>hit points</em> (think old D&amp;D games, or the collector card
            games like
            <em>MAGICK THE GATHERING</em>). For major characters, these would be
            fairly set but they can all change. In other words, a minor
            character in the short story LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME could become a
            major character in a different story, thus changing hit point
            values.

                baseball cards in cellephane wrappers) … you never know what
                you’ll get; could be all common cards or could include one or

          I’m sure there are more ways to provide utility and add to the fun of

          this community and participate.

        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">
          WHY I’m creating the Sputnik characterDAO
        </h3>
        <p>
          I conceived of this story and this character. But I’m fascinated by
          new methods of storytelling and I think{" "}
          <em>decentralized storytelling</em> is a fascinating and terrifying
          approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fascinating because it opens up so many (as yet unknown) possibilities
          for story direction. One reason TV shows and movies tell such amazing
          stories is because they are <em>collaborative</em>. I want to explore
          this idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terrifying because it means giving up control of something I’ve
          created and am passionate about.
        </p>
        <p>As a writer, I am of the old skool pulp approach to writing.</p>
        <p>
          Pulp fiction (not the movie!) is an old form of writing that often
          gets a bad rap, especially from the ivory tower academic crowd would
          eschew “commercial” writing for “Literature” (yes, with a capital
          ‘L’). They naturally overlook the fact that two of their Literary
          heroes, Shakespeare and Dickens, were the ultimate in commercial and
          pulp writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They describe pulp fiction (again, not the movie!) as “cheap, poorly
          written” stories. Nothing could be further from the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulp fiction, which derives its name from the inexpenseive wood pulp
          paper it was printed on, is emotion-driven, exciting, storytelling.
          The ivory tower wonks will tell you that it is low on characterization
          and plot heavy. That’s because (1) they’ve never read any, and (2)
          what they consider “Literature” is often just a mess of incoherent
          babble that tries to sell itself as story. Or something. Ever read
          Hemingway’s THE SUN ALSO RISES? Utter garbage, in my humble opinion.
          And Hemingway was, in reality, one of the great pulpeeters!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, pulp writing is plot heavy. Plot being “stuff that happens.”
          And yes, there is a lot of crap written and published. But pulp
          fiction is about story and story is how we, as human beings, have
          always learned about and understood the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without story, there is not understanding. It permiates everything we
          do, from science to religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But pulp writing is more than just story. It is, from my perspective
          as a writer, an approach to writing. In involves, among other things,
          Heinlein’s Five Rules (as explained Dean Wesley Smith’s excellent book
          explaining the rules: HEINLEINS’S RULES: FIVE SIMPLE BUSINESS RULES
          FOR WRITING).
        </p>
        <p>They are:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>You must write.</li>
          <li>You must finish what you start.</li>
          <li>You must refrain from rewriting except to editorial order.</li>
          <li>You must put it on the market.</li>
          <li>You must keep it on the market until sold.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Simple to understand. Hard to do.</p>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, it means write everyday, finish it, and market it.
          Don’t do infinite rewrites (in fact, NEVER rewrite, except to clean up
          and copy edit).
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, rule #1 also means write a lot. Write fast. Let the story
          evolve naturally and explore it as it comes out of your imagination.
          Don’t outline it to death (set sign posts, if necessary but WRITE INTO
          THE DARK (another excellent Dean Welsely Smith book).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also fascinated by the rhythm of story. The ebbs and flows. Pulp
          fiction is often looked down upon because it is formulaic. But that is
          its power, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph Campbell, the great mythologist, determined that there is what
          he called the <em>monomyth</em> or single unified theory of
          storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          All story, all myth, follows — to varying degrees — the same basic
          structure. This has been further evaluated and defined by people like
          Chris Vogler in his book THE WRITER’S JOURNEY: MYTHIC STRUCTURE FOR
          WRITERS and Chris Soth’s MILLION DOLLAR SCREENWRITING in which he
          breaks the same basic structure into what he calls mini-movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These structures, these formulae are the basis for my short story
          structure over the next 24 weeks, leading to the publication of THE
          BUTTERFLY COLLECTOR v2.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">The actual Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
          That is what I’m trying to do with this writing project. Write a lot.
          Write every day. Tell great stories. Finish what I start and put it to
          market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting March 28, 2022, I will write every day. I aim to write a
          minimum of 1,000 words a day with a real goal of 5,000 words a day
          towards my stories. Most of this writing will be around the Sputnik
          stories but will occationally be other stories like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ZOMBIES FROM OUTER SPACE — a sci-fi, alien invasion story in homage
            to the classic movies of the 1950s and 1960s plus zombies
          </li>
          <li>
            THE TESTAMENTS OF KRILL — my dark fantasy horror novella series I
            started 18 months ago
          </li>
          <li>
            KILROY WAS HERE — a storification of the WW2 (and earlier) meme of
            an Allied super spy operating against the Nazis during the war
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Mostly, I’ll be writing new short stories and longer works in the flow
          from LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME to the revised edition of the novel THE
          BUTTERFLY COLLECTOR.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is my basic mini-movie structure and how it will work out
          as individual short stories, novelettes, novellas, and finally the
          novel:

          As you can see, most of the overall structure is there, with key sign
          posts along the way. But the full story is undefined. That is on
          purpose. This will be written <em>in public, with the public</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week, I will publish the new short story. The readership and
          community can react and provide feedback, commentary, etc., thus
          guiding how the story evolves.
        </p>
        <p>
          My overall goal is to set up and tell the same basic story currently
          in THE BUTTERFLY COLLECTOR v1, but with the story evolving as my
          community of readers and contributors guides.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am taking a page from one of the great pulpeteers, Charles Dickens.
          He wrote what are now great books like THE PICKWICK PAPERS in serial
          format. A chapter a week kind of thing. He’d publish, distribute and
          then adjust the subsequent story in reaction to his audiences likes
          and dislikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a character was hated, he dropped them. When a character was
          loved, he added more of that character.
        </p>
        <p>That is the basic approach.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">How will it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Each story will be published to Mirror.xyz and be available for
          support through their crowdfunding. That means you can donate to my
          financial ability to continue producing this storyline. But more than
          that, by contributing finacially, you become part of the community,
          part of the story itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will gain access to a private Discord server, with extra-private
          rooms for contributors. You will have the opportunity to contribute
          weekly, or buy one of the various NFTs I have planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a certain level of ownership of the $SPUTNIK token, you’ll gain
          governance rights over story direction, voting privileges for things
          like artwork, shifts to other media (a Sputnik movie, anyone?!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Early access to NFT releases … get one of the 100 print editions of
          THE BUTTERFLY COLLECTOR v1. Imagine owning a signed, numbered copy of
          a HARRY POTTER draft?
        </p>
        <p>More (feel free to join the Discord and contribute more ideas!).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg mt-8 mb-4 uppercase">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          I’m sure this Roadmap is incomplete. Lots of holes. But this is only
          V1 of my ideas. It is a brain dump of what I’ve been thinking over the
          last several months as I’ve learned about the possibilities behind
          blockchain, web3, and decentralization.
        </p>
        <p>
          I welcome your comments, you input, your advice, your criticism. What
          else could I do to create a fun, exciting world, to invite
          collaborators to explore decentralized storytelling? What should I do
          differently than described above?
        </p>
