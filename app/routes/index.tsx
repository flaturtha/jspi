            Out of the promis of a decentralized system &mdash; finance,
            business, commerce, goverment, religion &mdash; rose a darkness. An
            unexpected cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            But one so indisious, so hidden that most never even noticed. A
            darkness so complete that no one even suspected. Until it was too
            late &hellip;
          </p>
          <p>
            But one man caught a flash of the light and from that, felt the
            darkness
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, against this darkness &hellip; against evil so ensconced that
            it is buried eep in the inner fabric that holds our world, our
            society together &hellip; against this thing stands one man.
